	In the projects for this course I was solving the problem of what kind of data structure should be used for each situation.
These projects showed me that different data structures each have advantages and disadvantages so each type of program may
require different data structures. I approached the problem by comparing different data structures after experimenting with
each one individually. This was difficult, because I have very little experience with the data structures that I used in
this class. I overcame these roadblocks by studying different ways to solve each of the many problems that I was having.
One helpful action that I took was creating and editing pseudocode for the projects that I was working on. After I began
creating the program I had to go back and modify the pseudocode to make it more correct but it helped me get started. My
work on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs because originally I did not have
any experience with data structures besides strings and dictionaries. Linked lists, hash tables, and trees are all very
helpful in certain situations and I never knew that I could use those instead. My work on this project has also evolved
the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable because I got hands-on experience creating
modular programs with proper comments. Modular programs are created one piece at a time so it is easier to roll back changes.
